The inhabitants of Greve, Italy, place great importance on respect for time, tradition and quality. Their communities are shaped by a rich food culture of family and community identity. They value the pleasures of gastronomy and nurture relationships by sharing meals made with locally sourced ingredients and preserve the food culture of the region. Rooted in a quiet life, they find peace and joy in the simple life, cooking and eating. Their gratitude goes beyond mere nourishment. Rather, food is an important element that accompanies culture, history, and the joy of life, and respect for its quality and origin is directly linked to their happiness and satisfaction. Adhering to the integrity of the cuisine, all dishes are satisfying from authentic dishes that tell a story of tradition and craftsmanship. In this way, I believe that their pursuit of excellence in cuisine is connected to preserving the food culture and history of the region.







Miso soup is a Japanese food that has been adapted to other cultures due to cultural diffusion. Apparently, miso soups made overseas sometimes contain things that are not allowed in Japan, such as cheese, cauliflower, and even lemon.




There are many countries and regions that have arranged miso soup in a way that is different from Japanese food. Examples include the United States, Germany, South Korea, and China.



The reason why people put ingredients in miso soup that are unthinkable in Japan is because they try to incorporate foods that are commonly eaten in each region into miso soup. Therefore, miso soup is arranged differently from Japanese food in each culture.
